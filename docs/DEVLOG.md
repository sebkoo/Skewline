# DEVLOG

Decisions, the day they were made. The commit log says what changed; this says
why, and what I was unsure about.

## 2026-08-08 · commit 1 — pose and session types

Five files, no capture code. Testing one claim: a spatial result needs a
confidence beside it.

- **Pose and covariance in one struct.** Separable means some path drops one and
  the survivor still looks authoritative.
- **Four `SIMD4<Float>` columns, not `simd_float4x4`.** Apple ships no `Codable`
  for the simd matrices, so synthesis fails. Confirmed by compiling, not reading.
- **Explicit `Sendable` on every public type.** Load-bearing sooner than
  expected: `Transform4x4.identity` and `PoseCovariance6x6.zero` are
  `public static let`, and SE-0412 requires globals to be `Sendable`.
- **`Core` does not import ARKit.** `TrackingQuality` mirrors
  `ARCamera.TrackingState` by hand — keeps the boundary for commit 2 and the
  suite off a device framework.
- **Covariance layout is provisional.** Flat 36 `Double`, row-major, m²/rad².
  Quaternion tangent space likely once a model is fitted. Pose is `Float` and
  covariance `Double`; that asymmetry was not a decision.
- **Verified the test can fail.** Temporary encoder writing 36 zeros → red at
  the covariance expectation. Reverted. The round trip really does check that
  uncertainty survives.
- **Tests run on the Mac.** Xcode against an iPhone destination fails outright:
  tool-hosted test targets cannot use device destinations.
- **My brief said "no name in this commit"; `Package.swift` requires one.** It
  should have said "no brand". Package is `SpatialCapture`, targets unchanged.

## 2026-08-08 · commit 2 — the ingest boundary

Commit 1 claimed hardware-free testing with no hardware path to be independent
of. Now there is one.

- **`canImport(ARKit)` is true on macOS.** A stub ships in the SDK, so the import
  succeeds and `ARSession` is still missing. Gate became
  `#if canImport(ARKit) && os(iOS)`. Found by letting the build fail. `canImport`
  answers "can I import this", not "are the symbols here".
- **Protocol lives in `Capture`, not `Core`.** `Core` stays data-only and neither
  it nor `Replay` was touched. Wart: `Capture` needs `Replay` only for the
  `CaptureSession` type, which is arguably `Core` material — moving it reopens
  commit 1.
- **Pull, not push.** Concrete `AsyncThrowingStream` return rather than an
  associated type, so one non-generic consumer works against every conformer. If
  the consumer must know which source it holds, the boundary failed.
- **`.zero` covariance is a placeholder.** ARKit exposes no pose uncertainty. Not
  a claim that the error is zero.
- **`@unchecked Sendable` is honest, not proven.** `ARSessionDelegate` serialises
  callbacks; Swift cannot see that. A lock is the hardening if it needs one.
- **The iOS-only file is now type-checked.**
  `xcodebuild -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build` succeeded — ARKit module
  loaded, `SensorSource.swift` compiled for `arm64-apple-ios18.0`. Still never
  run.
- **Commit 1's log paid for itself.** It flagged that `platforms:` named only
  iOS; `AsyncThrowingStream` needed `.macOS(.v13)`. Twenty seconds, not twenty
  minutes.

## 2026-08-08 · commits 3–4 — licence, and a test that was lying

- **Apache-2.0, not MIT.** Patent grant — the clause legal review looks for
  before approving an outside dependency.
- **The round trip skipped three fields.** Per-field assertions covered
  transform, covariance and tracking quality, never `timestamp`, `id` or
  `startDate`. Now `#expect(decoded == session)`. Reads like deleting
  assertions; actually widens coverage, so the reason lives in the code. Cost: a
  vaguer failure message.
- **A command block with a manual edit in the middle gets pasted whole.** The
  edit was skipped and the commit message promised two things while the diff
  held one. Same shape as `--amend` acting on whatever HEAD happens to be.
  Either the command performs the edit or the edit is not in the block.
- **`git show --stat` caught it; no hook could.** A `commit-msg` hook checks that
  a subject is imperative, short and prefixed. It cannot check whether the
  subject is *true* of the diff. Guardrails police form, and form is not
  accuracy — worth remembering when the hooks go in.

## 2026-08-09 · naming the package

- **`Skewline`.** Two back-projected rays should meet at the point and never
  do; they are skew lines, and the length of their common perpendicular is
  the residual. The name is the thesis.
- **A package `name:` is not a module name.** Targets are what `import` sees,
  so nothing references it. Expected a sweep across the tree; the rename is
  one line and no source files.
- **An unavailable GitHub org handle was never a blocker.** A solo repository
  lives under a personal account and never needs the bare namespace.
  Candidates died on a constraint that was invented, and it was mine.
- **A coined word is not automatically free.** The most invented-looking
  candidate is a trading company with a mark published for opposition.
  Novelty is a guess about the world, not a fact about it.
